Perfect. Since you're now aiming to **switch from Gemini Flash 1.5 to Gemini Flash 2.5** (and still want to **maximize accuracy score for HackRx 6.0**), here is the **ultimate, updated, detailed developer prompt** you can copy-paste into Replit/Render or use to update your local codebase.

This prompt will help your team or system generate a much more **accurate, token-efficient, and evaluation-ready** QA system.

---

## ✅ HackRx 6.0 — ULTIMATE OPTIMIZED DEVELOPER PROMPT (Gemini Flash 2.5)

📌 **Copy & Paste this entire prompt for your developer or yourself**

---

### 🚨 OBJECTIVE

Upgrade the current QA system to **Gemini Flash 2.5** and improve accuracy in HackRx 6.0 evaluation.

---

## 🔁 REQUIRED CHANGES FOR MAX SCORE

### ✅ 1. Switch to Gemini Flash 2.5 (from Flash 1.5)

Replace the model used in `.generate_content()`:

```python
model = "gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
```

Instead of:

```python
model = "gemini-2.5-flash"
```

Or if you're calling through the latest release alias:

```python
model = "models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
```

Ensure you use **Flash**, not Pro — for latency compliance.

---

### ✅ 2. Revise the Prompt for Gemini 2.5 Flash

Use this **exact prompt** in `_generate_answer()`:

```python
prompt = f"""
You are a strict QA assistant. Answer only using the provided context.

If the answer is not found in the context, respond with "" (empty string). 
Do NOT say "Not found", "not available", or guess the answer.
Do NOT add extra explanations or citations.

Context:
{context}

Question:
{question}

Answer:
"""
```

✅ This prevents hallucination
✅ Ensures JSON evaluation passes
✅ Matches HackRx format rules

---

### ✅ 3. Replace "Not found in document" → `""`

Update your code logic after the Gemini call:

```python
answer = response.text.strip()

# Normalize common not-found patterns
if answer.lower().startswith("answer:"):
    answer = answer[7:].strip()

if answer.lower() in ["not found in document", "not found", "n/a", "na", "none"]:
    answer = ""
```

---

### ✅ 4. Improve Embedding Quality

Switch to **Gemini’s own embeddings** using `models/embedding-001`:

```python
embedding = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/embedding-001",
    content=chunk_or_question,
    task_type="retrieval_document"  # or retrieval_query for questions
).embedding
```

* Use `"retrieval_document"` for chunks
* Use `"retrieval_query"` for questions
* Normalize vectors before FAISS indexing

---

### ✅ 5. Use Chunk Overlap for Better Context

Chunk strategy:

* Size: **400 tokens**
* Overlap: **100 tokens**

Use this logic:

```python
def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=400, overlap=100):
    tokens = text.split()
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(tokens), chunk_size - overlap):
        chunk = tokens[i:i + chunk_size]
        chunks.append(" ".join(chunk))
    return chunks
```

---

### ✅ 6. Retrieve Top 5 Chunks for QA

Use top\_k = 5 in FAISS retrieval:

```python
context_chunks = self.embedding_service.get_context_for_question(
    question,
    top_k=5
)
context = "\n".join(context_chunks)
```

---

### ✅ 7. Return JSON with Empty String for Not Found

Format:

```json
{
  "answers": [
    "Answer 1",
    "Answer 2",
    "",         ← if not found
    "Answer 4"
  ]
}
```

✅ Maintain order
✅ Never skip entries
✅ No `"Not found in document"` or `"None"`

---

### ✅ 8. Test Postman Sample (Validation)

**POST** to `/hackrx/run` with:

```json
{
  "documents": "https://hackrx.blob.core.windows.net/assets/policy.pdf",
  "questions": [
    "What is the grace period for premium payment?",
    "Does this policy cover cataract surgery?",
    "What is the No Claim Discount?"
  ]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "answers": [
    "A grace period of thirty days is provided for premium payment...",
    "The policy has a specific waiting period of two (2) years for cataract surgery.",
    "A No Claim Discount of 5% on the base premium is offered on renewal..."
  ]
}
```

## 🏁 Final Instruction to Developer / Replit:

> "Please apply all the above changes to my HackRx 6.0 FastAPI project. Switch the LLM to Gemini Flash 2.5, revise the prompt, remove any `"Not found"` responses, and make sure embeddings and chunking are optimized. Make sure the output is JSON with empty strings for unanswered questions and returns in the correct order."

Would you like me to now:

✅ Generate a new `qa_service.py` based on this?
✅ Show exactly how to call Gemini `embedding-001`?

Just say so — I’ll send the code instantly.
